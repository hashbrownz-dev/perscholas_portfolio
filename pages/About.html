        <h3>An Interesting Fact</h3>
        <p>Before the pandemic, I worked for an event company that created ice sculptures and water features.  Below are videos of two projects I was apart of.</p>
        <div id = "clip1" class = "clip">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eG_BZ8z-NlQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>In the first clip, we partnered with Super Deluxe to see if we could create a functioning bong out of ice.  I programmed and operated the CNC machine that cut the silhouette of the swan in two halves.  You can briefly see a younger version of myself freezing the two halves together and putting them back in the freezer around the 1 minute mark.</p>

            <p>In the second clip, I had the privilege of attending the 2019 BET Music Awards, installing and operating a digital water curtain.  This project was a lot of fun, because they gave me complete creative control over the design of the water show.</p>
